KeepInTouch
===========

A simple app that helps you keep in touch by periodically reminding you to text or call your friends.


KeepInTouch is an Android app designed to help you stay in contact with those people that you might not talk to more than once every couple of weeks. Just select a contact, set a timeframe, and the app will notify you if that much time passes without talking to the contact. Whenever you text, call, or email that person, this timer resets, so you'll only get notifications if too much time passes between communications.
